## Running the Benchmark

To run the full benchmark, use the provided shell script. For example:

./run_full_benchmark.sh videofile.h264

text

- Replace `videofile.h264` with your input video file.

You will be prompted to specify how many times you want to run the algorithm in parallel. Enter the desired number to proceed.

During execution, youâ€™ll be presented with options. If you select **option `0`**, the script will:
- Run all benchmarks.
- Generate charts.
- Create a PowerPoint presentation (PPT).

> **Note:** Selecting option 0 will take longer because it performs both the benchmarks and the full reporting.

Feel free to modify this template with more details about your project, usage examples, or specific instructions tailored to your workflow.
